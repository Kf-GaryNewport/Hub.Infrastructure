## Description
The HUB infrastructure project is a single repository, so we can address a group of essential requirements which govern the deployment and running of the HUB aspplication.
If we took each requirement separately then we may leave holes or cause other requirements to take non ideal flows.

## Build and Deployment
* principcals
  * The build and deployment phases of the application should be consistent and idempotent. 
  * Scripts should be environment agnostic
